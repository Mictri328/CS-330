How do I approach designing software?

    I like to approach my software projects one step at a time. Start with a main idea or point and bulletin the additional addons as I expand on what I want to create.
    This entire class has been great in working by teaching each skill step by step and seeing the final product come together. Also the way our projects rely heavily
    on using many different folders and files and combining them help to show how large code organization works. These techniques can help me to better all my future
    projects done with programming. 


How do I approach developing programs?

    I approach my projects similar to how we progressed throughout this class. I start with a main goal that needs to be accomplished. After I have a base goal I
    start to add different components and ideas to a storyboard style chart and have them branch off so I can work on each piece one at a time and by priority.
    I also like to test frequently so that any issues that arise can be traced back to the most recent code added into the project.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    
    My goals are all based on software engineering so they line up perfectly with my future. Using the methods of development and now understanding the basics
    of graphics and visualization also mean if I were to get into game development I would be able to adept and evolve to use more modern engines easier. Even
    if I dont get into game development and stick to developing software the basics we used in development here can be used in any software development environment.
